Featured Image Reminder will display a confirmation dialog box if you press the Publish button and the post doesn't have a featured image.

== Description ==

Featured Image Reminder came about because some forgetful blogger (me) had a site where featured images were important and he kept publishing blog posts without the featured image being prepared. 

When the plugin is installed and activated, and you try to publish a post without a featured image, a dialog box will appear asking if you really want to do that.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `featured-image-reminder.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Screenshots ==

1. This is the message shown if you forget to include a featured image.  Choosing "Cancel" gives you the opportunity to add your forgotten image.  If you choose "OK" the post will be published.

== Changelog ==
